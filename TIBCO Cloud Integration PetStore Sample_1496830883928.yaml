  description: To get you started with the API Modeling and Mock capabilities of TIBCO
    Cloud Integration we've created a sample API Specification for you. This sample
    shows an API Specification for a PetStore API that can GET (retrieve), POST (create),
    PUT (create/update), PATCH (update) and DELETE pets in the store. To make things
    easier we've only created a small specification with a single resource '/pet/{petId}'

  /pet/{petId}:
    delete:
      consumes:

      description: The DELETE method in an API Specification is used to remove a resource
        from the API. In this case it would remove the pet with the petId you specify
        when calling the API. When you create a [Mock application](https://integration.cloud.tibco.com/docs/mockapp/creatingMockApp/index.html#APIModeler)
        from this specification it will also show you a sample response.
